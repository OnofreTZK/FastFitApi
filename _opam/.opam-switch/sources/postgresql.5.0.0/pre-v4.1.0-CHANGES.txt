2004-08-26:  Small internal code-improvement.

2004-08-05:  Several significant improvements: the oid type is now
             revealed as int in the interface.  The "ftype"-method has
             been changed to return the new type "ftype".  The latter
             lists 60 constructors, which specify the types of fields.

             The change comes with new conversion functions:

               * ftype_of_oid
               * oid_of_ftype
               * string_of_ftype
               * ftype_of_string

             And with new exceptions:

               * exception Oid of oid
               * exception InternalError of string

2004-02-21:  Added CAMLprim in the C-interface where appropriate.

2004-02-08:  Fixed minor bugs concerning returning unit values from C.

2004-01-29:  Some major changes to interface to use or improve handling
             of default arguments. Effected methods:

               * escape_string
               * escape_bytea
               * getline
               * getline_async
               * putnbytes
               * lo_write
               * lo_read
               * lo_seek

             Removed methods (obsolete due to default arguments - use
             "lo_write" instead):

               * lo_write_string

             Added functions:

               * unescape_bytea

2004-01-28:  First release.
