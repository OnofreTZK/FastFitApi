(** {2 Error Causes}

    The {!cause} type is an incomplete enumeration of consolidated causes of
    errors between different database systems.  The selection includes the
    causes which are believed to be useful to handle and excludes causes which
    are specific to the implementation of a certain database system.

    The causes are classified into subtypes to help matching them collectively.
    Each subtype has a fall-back case which is used if the database system does
    not clearly report one of the specific cases.  An condition which is
    reported as the fall-back case may in a future version be reported as a
    specific case, possibly adding a new case to the subtype.  Therefore, for
    backwards compatibility you should match the full subtype rather than the
    fall-back, e.g.
    {[
      (match Caqti_error.cause error with
       | `Unique_violation -> handle_unique_violation ()
       | #integrity_constraint_violation -> handle_other_constraint_violation ()
       | _ -> handle_other_error ())
    ]}
    This ensures that your code stil compiles when a new case is added to
    {!integrity_constraint_violation}, and that the error condition receiving
    mapped to the new case is still handled by the subtype pattern when you link
    to the new version of Caqti.

    Currently we do not have access to the extended error codes from SQLite3,
    meaning that all integrity constraint violation conditions will be reported
    as [`Integrity_constraint_violation__don't_match].

    Since the consolitation of each error condition requires some investitation
    and testing, the selection made is very conservative.  If you need to handle
    an error which is currently unlisted, please open an issue or create a pull
    request.  A pull request should, if possible, include a extension of
    [test_error_cause.ml] to demonstrate how the error is triggered by the
    database systems. *)
