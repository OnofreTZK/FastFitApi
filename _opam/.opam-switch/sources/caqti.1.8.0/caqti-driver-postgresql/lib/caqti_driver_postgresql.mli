(** PostgreSQL driver for Caqti (bindings).

    This driver is implemented in terms of the postgresql OPAM package which
    provides bindings for the PostgreSQL C client library.

    It handles URIs of the form
    {[
      postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<rest>
    ]}
    which are passed verbatim to {!Postgresql.connection}, and URIs of the form
    [postgresql://<query>] which are first split into [<key> = '<value>'] form.

    Additionally the query option [notice_processing] can be set to [quiet] (the
    default) to suppress notices or to [stderr] to emit notices to standard
    error.  This option is interpreted by the Caqti driver and stripped off
    before passing the URI to libpq.

    The interface provided by this module {e should normally not be used by
    applications}, but provides access to some PostgreSQL specifics in case they
    are needed. *)
