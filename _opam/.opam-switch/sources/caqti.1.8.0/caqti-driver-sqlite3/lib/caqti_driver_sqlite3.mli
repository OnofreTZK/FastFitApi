(** Sqlite3 driver for Caqti (bindings).

    This driver is implemented in terms of the sqlite3 OPAM package, which
    provides bindings for libsqlite3.  It handles URIs of the form
    {[
      sqlite3://<path>?create=<bool>&write=<bool>
    ]}
    where [<path>] is passed to {!Sqlite3.db_open} and the query string is used
    to determine its [mode] parameter.  The [<bool>] parameters take the values
    [true] and [false], and default to [true].

    The interface provided by this module {e should normally not be used by
    applications}, but provides access to some Sqlite3 specifics in case they
    are needed. *)

(** {1 Error Details}

    The following provides access to diagnostics collected from the Sqlite3
    connection. *)

type Caqti_error.msg += Error_msg of {
  errcode: Sqlite3.Rc.t;
    (** The OCaml encoding of the error code reported by [sqlite3_errcode]. *)
  errmsg: string option;
    (** The error message reportedy by [sqlite3_errmsg]. *)
}
