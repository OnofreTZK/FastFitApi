(** Query specification. *)

type t =
  | L of string (** Literal code. May contain incomplete fragments. *)
  | Q of string (** [Q s] corresponds to a [TEXT] literal; passed as part of the
                    query string if a suitable quoting function is available in
                    the client library, otherwise passed as an additional
                    parameter. *)
  | P of int    (** [P i] refers to parameter number [i], counting from 0. *)
  | E of string (** [E name] is expanded by the environemnt lookup function. *)
  | S of t list (** [S frags] is the concatenation of [frags]. *)
(** A representation of a query string to send to a database, abstracting over
    parameter references and providing nested concatenation to simplify
    generation.  For databases which only support linear parameters (typically
    denoted "[?]"), the driver will reshuffle, elide, and duplicate parameters
    as needed.  *)

val normal : t -> t
(** [normal q] rewrites [q] to a normal form containing at most one top-level
    {!S} constructor, containing no empty literals, and no consecutive literals.
    This function can be used to post-process queries before using {!equal} and
    {!hash}. *)

val equal : t -> t -> bool
(** Equality predicate for {!t}. *)

val hash : t -> int
(** A hash function compatible with {!equal}.  This is currently
    {!Hashtbl.hash}. *)

val pp : Format.formatter -> t -> unit
(** [pp ppf q] prints a {e human}-readable representation of [q] on [ppf].
    The printed string is {e not suitable for sending to an SQL database}; doing
    so may lead to an SQL injection vulnerability. *)

val show : t -> string
(** [show q] is the same {e human}-readable representation of [q] as printed by
    {!pp}.
    The returned string is {e not suitable for sending to an SQL database};
    doing so may lead to an SQL injection vulnerability. *)

val concat : string -> t list -> t
(** [concat sep frags] is [frags] interfixed with [sep] if [frags] is non-empty
    and the empty string of [frags] is empty. *)

type expand_error
(** A description of the error caused during {!expand} if the environment lookup
    function returns an invalid result or raises [Not_found] for a variable when
    the expansion is final. *)

val pp_expand_error : Format.formatter -> expand_error -> unit
(** Prints an informative error. *)

exception Expand_error of expand_error
(** The exception raised by {!expand} when there are issues expanding an
    environment variable using the provided callback. *)

val expand : ?final: bool -> (string -> t) -> t -> t
(** [expand f q] replaces each occurrence of [E v] some some [v] with [f v] or
    leaves it unchanged where [f v] raises [Not_found]. The [Not_found]
    exception will not escape this call.

    @param final
      If [true], then an error is raised instead of leaving environment
      references unexpended if [f] raises [Not_found].  This is used by drivers
      for performing the final expansion.  Defaults to [false].

    @raise Expand_error
      if [~final:true] is passed and [f] raise [Not_found] or if [f] returns a
      query containing environment references. *)

val angstrom_parser : t Angstrom.t
(** Matches a single expression terminated by the end of input or a semicolon
    lookahead. The accepted languages is described in {{!query_template} The
    Syntax of Query Templates}. *)

val of_string : string -> (t, [`Invalid of int * string]) result
(** Parses a single expression without semicolon.  The error indicates the byte
    position of the input string where the parse failure occurred in addition to
    an error message. See {{!query_template} The Syntax
    of Query Templates} for how the input string is interpreted. *)

val of_string_exn : string -> t
(** Parses the same strings as {!of_string}.

    @raise Failure if parsing failed. *)
